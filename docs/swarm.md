# Orchestrating Fly.io Instances with TypeScript: A Comprehensive Guide

Fly.io offers several ways to automate and orchestrate your infrastructure using TypeScript. This report explores available libraries, SDKs, and examples for managing Fly.io resources programmatically, covering networking, secrets management, and other capabilities.

## Available TypeScript Solutions for Fly.io Orchestration

There are currently three main options for orchestrating Fly.io infrastructure using TypeScript, each with varying levels of functionality and community support.

### fly-admin: Official TypeScript Client

The `fly-admin` package is a TypeScript client developed by Supabase that provides comprehensive capabilities for managing Fly.io infrastructure.

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'fly-admin'

const fly = createClient('FLY_API_TOKEN')

async function deployApp() {
  const machine = await fly.Machine.createMachine({
    app_name: 'myAppId',
    image: 'supabase/postgres',
  })
}
```

This client offers extensive functionality for managing apps, machines, networks, organizations, secrets, and volumes[2][7].

### fly-machines-sdk: Alternative TypeScript SDK

Another option is the `fly-machines-sdk`, which focuses specifically on Fly.io Machines:

```typescript
import { FlyMachinesSDK } from 'fly-machines-sdk';

const apiKey = process.env.FLY_TOKEN;
const orgSlug = 'personal';
const sdk = new FlyMachinesSDK(apiKey, orgSlug);

await sdk.createApplicationOnMachine({ name: 'app_name', config: {} });
```

This SDK is particularly helpful for creating and managing applications and machines together[9].

### Custom TypeScript Client via OpenAPI Specification

For those who need more customization, you can generate a TypeScript client using the OpenAPI specification for the Fly Machines API:

```typescript
// Generate client using tools like OpenAPI Generator
// Then use the generated client:
const client = new FlyMachinesClient(apiKey);
```

While Fly.io doesn't officially provide an OpenAPI spec, community members have created and shared fixed specifications that can be used to generate clients[5][13].

## Managing Applications

Applications are the basic building blocks in Fly.io. Here's how to manage them with TypeScript:

### Creating and Deploying Applications

```typescript
// Using fly-admin
const fly = createClient('FLY_API_TOKEN')

// Create a new app
const app = await fly.App.createApp({
  name: 'my-typescript-app',
  organization_id: 'my-org-id'
})

// Deploy a machine for this app
const machine = await fly.Machine.createMachine({
  app_name: app.name,
  config: {
    image: 'nodejs:16',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
    }
  }
})
```

### Listing and Getting Applications

```typescript
// List all apps
const apps = await fly.App.listApps()

// Get details of a specific app
const appDetails = await fly.App.getApp('my-app-name')
```

## Managing Machines

Machines are the compute instances running your applications:

### Creating and Configuring Machines

```typescript
// Create a machine with specific configuration
const machine = await fly.Machine.createMachine({
  app_name: 'my-app',
  config: {
    image: 'supabase/postgres',
    guest: {
      cpu_kind: 'shared',
      cpus: 1,
      memory_mb: 256
    },
    services: [
      {
        ports: [
          {
            port: 5432,
            handlers: ['pg']
          }
        ],
        protocol: 'tcp',
        internal_port: 5432
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

### Machine Lifecycle Management

```typescript
// Start a machine
await fly.Machine.startMachine('my-app', 'machine-id')

// Stop a machine
await fly.Machine.stopMachine('my-app', 'machine-id')

// Restart a machine
await fly.Machine.restartMachine('my-app', 'machine-id')

// Delete a machine
await fly.Machine.deleteMachine('my-app', 'machine-id')
```

### Machine Monitoring

```typescript
// List machine processes
const processes = await fly.Machine.listProcesses('my-app', 'machine-id')

// List machine events
const events = await fly.Machine.listEvents('my-app', 'machine-id')

// List machine versions
const versions = await fly.Machine.listVersions('my-app', 'machine-id')
```

## Networking Capabilities

Managing network resources is crucial for application connectivity:

### IP Address Management

```typescript
// Allocate an IP address
const ipv4 = await fly.Network.allocateIpAddress({
  app_name: 'my-app',
  type: 'v4'
})

// Allocate an IPv6 address
const ipv6 = await fly.Network.allocateIpAddress({
  app_name: 'my-app',
  type: 'v6'
})

// Release an IP address
await fly.Network.releaseIpAddress('my-app', 'ip-address-id')
```

## Secrets Management

Secrets allow you to securely store sensitive information:

```typescript
// Set secrets
await fly.Secret.setSecrets('my-app', [
  {
    name: 'DATABASE_URL',
    value: 'postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db'
  },
  {
    name: 'API_KEY',
    value: 'my-secret-api-key'
  }
])

// Unset secrets
await fly.Secret.unsetSecrets('my-app', ['OLD_API_KEY'])
```

## Volume Management

Volumes provide persistent storage for your applications:

```typescript
// List volumes
const volumes = await fly.Volume.listVolumes('my-app')

// Create a volume
const volume = await fly.Volume.createVolume({
  app_name: 'my-app',
  name: 'data',
  size_gb: 10,
  region: 'ams'
})

// Extend a volume
await fly.Volume.extendVolume('my-app', 'volume-id', {
  size_gb: 20
})

// Delete a volume
await fly.Volume.deleteVolume('my-app', 'volume-id')
```

## Practical Use Cases

### Deploying a TypeScript Node.js Application

For deploying TypeScript applications to Fly.io, you'll need to configure your project appropriately. Here's an example of a Dockerfile for a TypeScript Node.js application:

```dockerfile
ARG NODE_VERSION=16.13.2
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim as base

WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

FROM base as build
RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y python pkg-config build-essential && \
    npm install -g typescript

COPY package-lock.json package.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM base
COPY --from=build /app/build /app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "node", "build/index.js" ]
```

This setup will build your TypeScript application and run it in production mode[11].

### Creating a Load Balancer with Multiple Regions

```typescript
// Create an app
const app = await fly.App.createApp({ name: 'load-balanced-app' })

// Create machines in different regions
const regions = ['ams', 'sea', 'hkg']
for (const region of regions) {
  await fly.Machine.createMachine({
    app_name: app.name,
    region,
    config: {
      image: 'my-app-image',
      env: { REGION: region }
    }
  })
}

// Allocate a shared IPv4 address
await fly.Network.allocateIpAddress({
  app_name: app.name,
  type: 'v4'
})
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript offers powerful options for orchestrating Fly.io infrastructure. The `fly-admin` client provides the most comprehensive functionality, while `fly-machines-sdk` offers a more focused approach for machine management. For custom needs, generating a client from the OpenAPI specification gives you complete control.

By combining these tools with Fly.io's infrastructure, you can build sophisticated, programmatically managed applications that span multiple regions, incorporate proper secrets management, and utilize persistent storage-all from the comfort of your TypeScript codebase.

Perfect. I will prepare a fully structured, production-grade codebase that implements your remote agentic VS Code Docker infrastructure. This will include:

- Manager backend (TypeScript, Express)
- Agent sidecar (TypeScript)
- WebSocket event-driven communication
- TypeScript SDK (NPM package-ready)
- Kubernetes Helm charts (manager, workspace)
- Dockerfiles (for manager, agent, VSCode workspace images)
- Nginx/Traefik proxy configuration templates
- Deployment automation scripts (Terraform/Kubernetes optional)
- Security best practices embedded (HTTPS, session handling)
- Documentation per component

I'll break it into logically separate files and folders, so you can immediately build, test, and deploy.

I will get started and keep you updated step-by-step as the structure is ready.

# Remote Agentic Architecture for Multi-Instance VS Code Servers

This repository provides a **complete, production-grade implementation** of the *Remote Agentic Architecture* for managing multiple VS Code server instances (based on [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)) in Docker and Kubernetes. It includes a manager service for orchestration, an in-container agent for health and control, a TypeScript SDK for integrations, Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment, and configuration for secure reverse proxying via Nginx/Traefik. All components are designed with **modularity**, **security** (HTTPS, auth, network isolation), and **real-time observability** in mind.

## Manager Backend (Express.js & Docker Orchestration)

The **Manager** is the central server orchestrating workspaces. It's a Node.js Express application written in TypeScript. It exposes a **RESTful API** for management operations, a **WebSocket** server for real-time notifications, and it interfaces with Docker (or Kubernetes) to create/destroy VS Code server instances on demand.

**Key responsibilities:**

- **Workspace Lifecycle Management:** Create, start, stop, and remove workspace containers/pods for each user.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Only allow authorized requests (e.g. via API tokens or session cookies).
- **Resource Coordination:** Ensure each workspace gets the correct resources (volume, CPU/mem limits, network).
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track workspace status (running, stopped, idle) and broadcast events (via WebSocket) to clients.
- **Security Enforcement:** Isolate workspaces in a private network, enforce HTTPS access, and implement per-user access controls.

### REST API Endpoints

The manager defines a REST API under `/api`. For example:

- `POST /api/workspaces` – **Create** a new workspace container/Pod for a user. Expects parameters like user ID, image (optional), resources, etc. Returns an ID or name of the created workspace and connection info (e.g. the subdomain URL).
- `GET /api/workspaces` – **List** active workspaces (admin-only or filtered to the authenticated user’s workspaces).
- `GET /api/workspaces/{id}` – **Get status** and details of a specific workspace (CPU/memory usage, uptime, etc).
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}` – **Stop** and remove a workspace.
- `POST /api/workspaces/{id}/restart` – Restart a workspace container (if needed).
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/workspaces` – List workspaces for a specific user (if authorized as that user or admin).
- `POST /api/auth/login` – Authenticate a user (e.g., verify credentials) and issue a JWT or session cookie.
- `GET /api/auth/validate` – (Used by proxy) Validate an auth token or cookie (returns 200 if valid, 401 if not, for Nginx/Traefik auth requests).

These endpoints are protected by an **authentication middleware**. For simplicity, the manager can use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for auth: users log in and receive a JWT which must be included (e.g., in the `Authorization` header) on subsequent API calls. The manager verifies the token on each request to ensure the user is allowed to perform the action. For admin-level actions (like listing all workspaces), the token must carry an admin role claim.

### WebSocket Server for Events

In addition to the REST API, the manager runs a WebSocket server (for example on path `/api/events` or a separate port) so that clients (including the web UI or CLI using the SDK) can receive push notifications in real time. The agent inside each workspace also uses a WebSocket (or a similar mechanism) to communicate back to the manager.

**WebSocket events broadcasted:**

- `workspaceCreated` – when a new workspace container is successfully launched (includes workspace ID, user, etc).
- `workspaceStarted` / `workspaceStopped` – when a workspace's VS Code server process starts or stops.
- `workspaceRemoved` – when a workspace is removed (e.g., after stopping and cleanup).
- `heartbeat` – periodic ping from each workspace (could be aggregated if many, or just used internally).
- `workspaceError` – if a workspace encounters an error (e.g. failure to start, crash, etc).
- `log` – streaming logs from workspace (optional, can be toggled for debugging or monitoring).
- Other events: e.g., `userConnected` (when a user opens their IDE, triggers a heartbeat), `idleTimeout` (if a workspace has been idle too long and is auto-stopped).

Clients can filter events (for example, only receive events for workspaces they own). The WebSocket messages contain JSON with event type and payload. For example:

```json
{
  "event": "workspaceStarted",
  "data": { "id": "workspace-abc123", "user": "alice", "url": "https://alice.dev.example.com" }
}
```

The manager uses an in-memory list of WebSocket subscribers and broadcasts relevant events to each. **Authentication on WebSocket**: To secure it, the client must either connect with a query param or header containing their auth token (which the server verifies in the handshake) or use a cookie from the REST auth. This ensures only authorized users receive sensitive events. Separate channels or namespaces can be used if utilizing a library like Socket.IO, but a plain WebSocket with simple auth and message filtering also works.

### Docker Orchestration via Dockerode

The manager uses **Dockerode** (the Node Docker client) to manage containers on the host. It connects to the Docker daemon (usually by mounting the `/var/run/docker.sock` socket into the manager container, or by pointing Dockerode at the host/port if remote). Using Docker’s API allows programmatic control of container lifecycle.

When a request to create a workspace comes in, the manager will do roughly the following:

1. **Pull the VS Code Server Image** (if not already): e.g., `coder/code-server` or our custom image. (In Kubernetes mode, the image will be pulled by K8s, but in Docker mode the manager ensures the image is available.)
2. **Create a container** with the appropriate configuration:
   - **Image:** the code-server image (e.g., `myrepo/code-server-workspace:latest` which includes the agent).
   - **Command/Entrypoint:** to start code-server (and agent). If using our custom image, the entrypoint will handle both.
   - **Environment Variables:** e.g., set `PASSWORD` or better, disable password auth by `--auth none` flag (we configure this in the image entrypoint) ([How to disable password to use code-server? · Issue #1567 · coder/code-server · GitHub](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/1567#:~:text=binari%20%20%20commented%20,67)). Also pass in a unique workspace ID, user name, and a secret token for the agent to use when connecting to manager.
   - **Ports:** code-server typically runs on 8080 internally. We might **not** publish this port to host (no `-p`) because we will use an internal network and a reverse proxy instead of exposing directly.
   - **Volumes:** mount a persistent volume for the user’s data (so their files persist across restarts). In Docker, this could be a named volume or a host path (e.g., `vscode-data-alice:/home/coder/project`).
   - **Network:** attach the container to an **internal Docker network** where the proxy and manager reside. We use a user-defined bridge network (say `workspace_net`) created with the `--internal` flag so it has no external route ([docker network create | Docker Docs
](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/network/create/#:~:text=Network%20internal%20mode%20%28)). This means workspace containers cannot access the internet except through configured proxies, enhancing security. The manager and proxy will be on this network to communicate with containers ([docker network create | Docker Docs
](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/network/create/#:~:text=Network%20internal%20mode%20%28)).
   - **Labels:** (especially if using Traefik for routing) add labels like `traefik.http.routers.user1.rule=Host(``` `user1.dev.example.com` ``` )` so that Traefik will pick up and route this container automatically. Also label the container with metadata (user, workspace ID) for easier management/cleanup.

3. **Start the container**: Once created, the manager starts it. Using Dockerode, this is as simple as:
   ```ts
   docker.createContainer({
     Image: workspaceImage,
     name: containerName,
     Env: [/* ... */],
     ExposedPorts: { "8080/tcp": {} },
     HostConfig: {
       NetworkMode: "workspace_net",
       Binds: ["vscode-data-alice:/home/coder/project"]
     },
     Labels: { "traefik.http.routers...": "...", "workspace.user": user }
   }).then(container => container.start());
   ```
   This corresponds to Docker API calls to create and then start the container ([GitHub - apocas/dockerode: Docker + Node = Dockerode (Node.js module for Docker's Remote API)](https://github.com/apocas/dockerode#:~:text=Creating%20a%20container%3A)). We check for errors and only proceed if the container is up.

4. **Post-Start Configuration:** After starting, the manager may perform additional setup:
   - Possibly exec into the container to run some init script, but in our design the agent in the container takes care of initialization (like configuring VS Code settings, etc., if needed).
   - Record the container ID and mapping in an internal state (e.g., an in-memory map or a lightweight database) so we know which workspace belongs to which user.
   - Open a persistent log stream: using Dockerode, we can attach to the container's stdout/stderr to capture logs. These logs can be forwarded to the WebSocket clients or stored for debugging.

5. **Emit Event:** Notify via WebSocket that workspace is created and running. 

For **stopping a workspace**, the manager will instruct Docker to stop the container (perhaps a graceful shutdown via the agent first), detach volumes if needed, and remove the container. Dockerode can list and remove containers easily (e.g., `docker.getContainer(id).stop()` then `.remove()` to clean up) ([GitHub - apocas/dockerode: Docker + Node = Dockerode (Node.js module for Docker's Remote API)](https://github.com/apocas/dockerode#:~:text=docker.createContainer%28,%2F%2F...%20%7D%29%3B)).

**Kubernetes Integration:** In cluster mode, instead of using Docker API, the manager can use the Kubernetes API (via an official client library or by shelling out to `kubectl`). It would create a Pod (or Deployment) in the cluster for the workspace. The Helm chart in `charts/workspace` can serve as a template: the manager could render it with the specific values (user, etc.) and apply it. This would create the pod, service, and PVC for the workspace. This design decouples the manager from Kubernetes specifics. (Alternatively, the manager could have a simpler logic: directly create K8s API objects using a library like `@kubernetes/client-node`.)

**Resource Limits:** The manager (or the K8s manifests) should set resource limits/requests on the workspace container to prevent one user from exhausting all host resources. For example, in Docker, use `HostConfig.CpuShares` or `Memory` limits; in K8s, specify `resources.limits` in the container spec.

### Authentication & Security (Manager)

Security is paramount. The manager uses middleware to authenticate API requests. An example implementation is using an Express middleware that checks for a bearer token:

```ts
// security.ts
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
export function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers['authorization']?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);
  try {
    const payload = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = payload; // attach decoded token (user info) to request
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    return res.sendStatus(403);
  }
}
```

All protected routes (like workspace management) use `authMiddleware`. The manager might support multiple roles (normal user vs admin). For example, an admin can list or stop any workspace, while a normal user can only manage their own. The middleware can enforce this by comparing `req.user.id` with the workspace’s owner for certain routes.

Additionally, the manager’s own APIs (especially sensitive ones like auth validation for the proxy) should ideally only be accessible internally. If using Kubernetes, run the manager behind the cluster’s ingress with proper routing rules (so only certain endpoints are exposed externally).

**Network isolation:** All workspace containers are on an isolated Docker network or Kubernetes namespace. In Docker, the `--internal` flag on the network ensures containers have no Internet route ([docker network create | Docker Docs
](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/network/create/#:~:text=Network%20internal%20mode%20%28)) (they can still reach the manager or proxy if those are on the same network). This prevents workspace containers from making arbitrary external calls, adding a layer of security. If internet access is needed for git pulls or package installs, one approach is to route traffic through a proxy that can be controlled or monitored, or selectively attach another network if appropriate. In Kubernetes, each workspace Pod can be in a separate Namespace with network policies restricting egress, or simply rely on cluster-level egress control.

**TLS & HTTPS:** The manager itself should ideally serve HTTPS, but typically it’s behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS. For simplicity, the manager’s Express app might run on HTTP (only accessible internally), and the external facing interface (the Nginx/Traefik proxy or K8s ingress) handles HTTPS. Ensure that all external connections (to VS Code web UI) are via `https://` URLs. Self-signed certificates should be avoided for production; use Let’s Encrypt or your org’s certificates for the wildcard domain.

**Domain & Subdomains:** This architecture uses a wildcard domain like `*.dev.example.com` for workspaces. As a best practice, use a **subdomain** (e.g., `dev.example.com` or `workspaces.example.com`) rather than a top-level wildcard (`*.example.com`), because browsers treat top-level wildcard domains specially and might block cookies ([Setup | Coder Docs](https://coder.com/docs/admin/setup#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20recommend%20using,proper%20operation%20of%20this%20feature)). For instance, setting `CODER_WILDCARD_ACCESS_URL=*.dev.example.com` (as in Coder) would be appropriate ([Setup | Coder Docs](https://coder.com/docs/admin/setup#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20recommend%20using,proper%20operation%20of%20this%20feature)). You will need a wildcard DNS record (e.g., `*.dev.example.com`) pointing to your server or load balancer.

**Authentication Integration with Proxy:** The proxy (Nginx/Traefik) will forward requests to the code-server containers. To ensure only the legitimate user can access their VS Code, the proxy can perform an auth check for each request. We configure the proxy with an **auth-request** (for Nginx) or **ForwardAuth** (Traefik) to query the manager’s auth validation endpoint. For example, Nginx can be set to call `http://manager:3000/api/auth/validate` (with the user’s session cookie) before proxying; if it returns 401, Nginx will block the request. This way, even though code-server’s built-in password auth is disabled (we run it with `--auth none` inside) ([How to disable password to use code-server? · Issue #1567 · coder/code-server · GitHub](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/1567#:~:text=binari%20%20%20commented%20,67)), our external auth ensures security. The **agent** inside the container can also know about the expected user token to further validate (though if network is properly isolated, that may not be necessary).

### Real-Time Observability and Metrics

To facilitate observability, the manager could expose metrics (e.g., a `/metrics` endpoint compatible with Prometheus, reporting number of active workspaces, CPU/Memory usage per workspace, etc.). It can gather stats via Docker (Dockerode can retrieve container stats streams) or K8s metrics. Logging is centralized: the manager logs significant events (container start/stop, user actions) and can retain workspace logs.

For example, integrating the Docker **/health** API: each code-server container has a `/healthz` HTTP endpoint that returns a JSON with a status and last heartbeat timestamp ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20healthz%20endpoint%3F)). The agent or manager can call this periodically. A simple approach is the manager occasionally docker-execs `curl localhost:8080/healthz` inside containers or (if network allows) hits `http://<container_ip>:8080/healthz`. This returns, for example, `{"status":"alive","lastHeartbeat":1599166210566}` ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20healthz%20endpoint%3F)). We use this to detect idle or unresponsive sessions. If status is "expired" or the heartbeat timestamp is old, the manager can decide to shut down the container (after a timeout) to free resources (this logic can also live in the agent).

**Audit Logging:** For enterprise use, it’s wise to log user actions (who started/stopped a workspace, when they connected, etc.). The manager can output these to a file or external logging service.

## Agent Sidecar (Workspace Internal Service)

Each workspace container runs a lightweight **Agent** process (written in TypeScript, compiled to Node.js) that acts as a “sidecar” inside the container. This Agent is responsible for maintaining the health of the VS Code server process and communicating with the manager for control signals.

**Agent responsibilities:**

- Send periodic **heartbeat** messages to the manager, indicating the workspace is alive and healthy.
- Monitor the VS Code server (code-server) process:
  - If the process exits or becomes unresponsive, report this to the manager (and possibly attempt a graceful shutdown or restart).
  - Optionally restart the code-server process if it crashed (to minimize downtime, though the manager might instead handle recreation).
- Listen for **commands** from the manager:
  - e.g., a shutdown command (to gracefully terminate the workspace from inside), or to run maintenance tasks (like clearing caches).
- Perform local **health checks**:
  - Query the local `/healthz` endpoint of code-server ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20healthz%20endpoint%3F)). If it reports "expired" (meaning no active VS Code connection) and a timeout has elapsed, the agent could initiate self-termination (to auto-stop idle environments). The heartbeat file timestamp (as mentioned in code-server docs) can be used to decide when to stop for inactivity ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=As%20long%20as%20there%20is,server%2Fheartbeat%60%20once%20a%20minute)).
- Possibly manage **port forwarding** or other sidecar tasks (though code-server itself can handle some port forwarding, the agent could assist or report open ports to the manager if needed for UI).

**Implementation details:**

- The agent is included in the `workspace-image`. It might either run as a separate process in the container or as PID 1 supervising code-server. **Two approaches**:
  1. **Single Container, Single Process:** Use a process manager (like a simple shell script entrypoint or PM2) to launch code-server and the agent concurrently. For example, `entrypoint.sh` could start the agent in the background, then exec code-server, or vice versa. However, ensuring both stay running is a bit complex.
  2. **Single Container, Agent as Supervisor:** Run the agent as the main process (PID 1). The agent then spawns the code-server process (child). The agent can capture the code-server output and monitor its exit code. If code-server exits, the agent can notify manager and also exit or restart it. In this model, stopping the container can be initiated by the agent on command or by just exiting when instructed.
  3. **Separate Sidecar Container:** In Kubernetes, we can deploy the agent as a separate container in the same Pod as code-server. They share the same volume and network namespace. The agent can ping `localhost:8080` for health and can, if needed, kill the code-server container (though cross-container signaling is tricky; more common is to rely on K8s to kill the pod). In Docker Compose, a separate agent container per workspace could be done, but it's simpler to keep one container.

For simplicity and compatibility, our design uses **Agent as Supervisor in the same container**. The `workspace-image/Dockerfile` will copy the compiled `agent.js` into the image and set the entrypoint to our custom `entrypoint.sh`. That script might look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# entrypoint.sh in workspace image
# Start the agent in the background
node /usr/local/bin/agent.js &   # agent.js path inside image
AGENT_PID=$!
# Start code-server (with no password auth, as we rely on external auth)
# Use exec so it becomes PID 1 after this script (if we want code-server to handle signals itself),
# but since we want to monitor it, we'll not exec and instead wait.
code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080 --auth none "$@" &
CODE_PID=$!
# Wait for code-server to exit
wait $CODE_PID
# If code-server exited, we can decide to also exit (which stops container) or attempt restart:
kill $AGENT_PID
```

This is a sketch: in practice the agent might be the one launching code-server via Node’s `child_process.spawn`, giving it more control (and to capture output). But a bash approach can also work.

**Heartbeat mechanism:** The agent will establish a WebSocket connection to the manager’s server (to a dedicated endpoint, e.g., `/api/agent`). It authenticates itself – possibly by using a secret token that the manager gave the container via an env variable at launch. For example, the manager could set an env `AGENT_TOKEN=<random>` which is also stored server-side; the agent sends this on connect to prove its identity. Once connected, every *N* seconds (configurable, e.g. 30 seconds) the agent sends a message like `{type: "heartbeat", id: "<workspace-id>", status: "ok", stats: {...}}`. The manager then updates the last-seen time for that workspace. 

If a heartbeat is missed (e.g., manager hasn’t heard from a workspace in, say, 2 intervals), the manager can mark it as unhealthy and trigger a recovery (maybe try to reconnect, or stop the container). This heartbeat complements the `/healthz` checks; essentially the agent pings proactively, and also the manager can pull if needed.

**Command handling:** The WebSocket connection is bi-directional. The manager can send messages to the agent, such as `{type: "shutdown", reason: "user requested"}`. The agent on receiving this would:
- Log the request,
- Gracefully shut down code-server (e.g., kill the process, or send it a SIGINT for graceful exit if it handles it),
- Disconnect from manager (or send a final message),
- Exit, which causes the container to stop. The manager’s Docker event listener will catch that the container stopped and emit a `workspaceStopped` event.

Other possible commands:
- `execute`: run a provided shell command in the container (for maintenance or gathering diagnostics).
- `update`: perhaps instruct the agent to apply some updates, like pulling new code-server version (though generally that would be done by replacing the container image).
- `flushLogs`: agent could send a batch of recent logs immediately.
  
These can be extended as needed. The communication protocol can be JSON messages over the WebSocket, documented for consistency.

**Local health monitoring:** The agent can keep an eye on system resources using Node APIs or Linux tools. For example, it can read `/proc/meminfo` or use a library to get memory usage, and send that in the heartbeat. If memory usage goes critical or process count grows unexpectedly, it can warn the manager. 

Crucially, the agent monitors **idle time**. Code-server touches a heartbeat file when the IDE is open in a browser ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20heartbeat%20file%3F)). If that file hasn't been updated in (say) an hour, the agent might decide the IDE is inactive and could auto-shutdown to save resources ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=As%20long%20as%20there%20is,server%2Fheartbeat%60%20once%20a%20minute)). Alternatively, the manager could make that decision after receiving heartbeats indicating idle status. Either way, implementing idle shutdown is a recommended practice (and making the timeout configurable per policy). For example, a config might say “stop workspaces after 60 minutes of inactivity” – the agent sees no active user and sends an event or simply exits, letting the manager handle container removal.

**Security in the agent:** The agent should be careful to verify any manager command (ensuring it indeed came from the authenticated manager connection). If the WebSocket disconnects, the agent should attempt reconnect a few times, and if it cannot, it might assume the manager is down; it can either keep running (so user doesn't lose work) and keep retrying, or eventually decide to shut down if it was a planned manager outage. In any case, the agent’s token prevents rogue connections. The agent only initiates outbound connections, so it doesn’t need to open any ports internally.

## TypeScript SDK (NPM Package)

The repository includes a **TypeScript SDK** (`/sdk`) that wraps the manager’s REST and WebSocket APIs for convenient use in other applications (for example, a web UI frontend or a CLI tool). This SDK can be published to NPM (e.g., as `@myorg/remote-code-sdk`) for developers to install.

**Features of the SDK:**

- Provides programmatic functions for all REST endpoints (e.g., `createWorkspace(user, options)`, `listWorkspaces()`, `stopWorkspace(id)` etc.), returning native JS/TS types (Promises that resolve to structured data).
- Manages authentication: e.g., includes a `login(username, password)` that calls the API and stores the returned token, automatically including it in subsequent calls.
- Handles the WebSocket event subscription behind the scenes and emits high-level events via an `EventEmitter` or callback mechanism. For instance, `sdk.on('workspaceStarted', handler)` to react to events instead of dealing with raw WebSocket messages.
- Is written in TypeScript with proper type definitions for all data structures (Workspace, User, Events, etc.), improving developer experience and reducing errors.

**SDK Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a frontend that needs to interact with this system. With the SDK, the code might look like:

```ts
import { RemoteCodeClient } from '@myorg/remote-code-sdk';

const client = new RemoteCodeClient({ baseUrl: "https://manager.example.com", token: "<JWT or API Key>" });

// Listen to workspace events
client.on('workspaceStarted', (workspace) => {
  console.log(`Workspace ${workspace.id} is ready at ${workspace.url}`);
});

// Create a new workspace for current user
const ws = await client.createWorkspace({ template: 'default' });
// The promise resolves when the manager *initiates* creation. The actual readiness will be signaled via the event.
console.log(`Workspace creation requested, ID = ${ws.id}`);

// Later, stop the workspace:
await client.stopWorkspace(ws.id);
```

Under the hood, `RemoteCodeClient` likely uses `fetch` or Axios for REST calls (which are straightforward since our API is RESTful JSON). It also opens a `WebSocket` to `<baseUrl>/api/events?token=<JWT>` to receive events. It parses incoming messages and re-emits them as typed events. The SDK ensures reconnection logic (if the socket closes unexpectedly, it will retry with exponential backoff) so the user of the SDK doesn’t have to handle that.

The SDK can also expose lower-level methods if needed (for example, an `execInWorkspace(id, cmd)` if the API supported running commands, or `getLogs(id)` to fetch logs).

**Publishing and Structure:** The SDK has its own `package.json` with name, version, and dependencies. Before publishing, it’s built (transpiled to JavaScript declarations, etc.). The types (`.d.ts`) are included so TypeScript projects get full autocompletion. We also include a `README.md` in the SDK folder specifically documenting how to use the SDK, with code examples like above.

## Dockerfiles and Container Images

We provide Dockerfiles for each component to containerize the application:

- **Manager Dockerfile (`manager/Dockerfile`):**  
  A multi-stage build can be used to reduce size. For example:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:18-alpine AS build
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package.json tsconfig.json yarn.lock ./
  RUN yarn install --production=false
  COPY src ./src
  RUN yarn build            # transpile TS to JS
  
  FROM node:18-alpine
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
  RUN yarn install --production=true && yarn cache clean
  COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
  EXPOSE 3000
  CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
  ```
  This results in a lightweight container running the Express app on port 3000. The Docker socket can be mounted when running this container (in Docker Compose or K8s, add a volume mount for `/var/run/docker.sock` and perhaps set `DOCKER_HOST=...` env if needed).

- **Agent Dockerfile (`agent/Dockerfile`):**  
  If the agent were to be a standalone container (sidecar), we'd need an image for it. It would be similar to the manager’s build (small Node runtime). However, in our design the agent is baked into the workspace image. We still include an `agent/Dockerfile` to allow building the agent image separately (maybe for testing or if one chooses the separate container approach). This Dockerfile might be as simple as:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:18-alpine
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package.json tsconfig.json yarn.lock ./
  RUN yarn install && yarn cache clean
  COPY src ./src
  RUN yarn build && mv dist/agent.js ./agent.js
  ENTRYPOINT ["node", "agent.js"]
  ```
  This would run the agent as PID1, expecting to connect to a manager (one would supply envs for manager host, workspace ID, token, etc.). In Kubernetes, if using a separate agent container, you'd use this image in the Pod spec alongside the code-server container.

- **Workspace (VS Code Server) Dockerfile (`workspace-image/Dockerfile`):**  
  This extends the official code-server image. For example:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM coder/code-server:4.13.0
  # Add our agent code
  COPY --from=agent-build-stage /app/agent.js /usr/local/bin/agent.js
  COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
  RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
  # Optionally install additional tools, e.g., git, curl, languages, etc. if needed.
  # Switch to root if needed for installation then back to coder user:
  USER root
  RUN apk add --no-cache git curl
  USER coder
  # Set the entrypoint
  ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
  ```
  We assume we have built the agent.js in a previous stage (`agent-build-stage` not shown here, but similar to above). The code-server image by default runs as user `coder` with a home directory at `/home/coder`. We ensure our entrypoint runs as root only if necessary or keep it as coder if possible. Running as non-root is preferred for security.

  The `entrypoint.sh` as discussed will start the agent and code-server. We ensure code-server is started with `--auth none` so it doesn't require a password login (since we handle auth externally) ([How to disable password to use code-server? · Issue #1567 · coder/code-server · GitHub](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/1567#:~:text=binari%20%20%20commented%20,67)). We also might set environment like `CODE_SERVER_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080` (or via the flag) and perhaps `CODE_SERVER_CERT=false` (since we terminate TLS at proxy). The code-server default config has password auth enabled ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=bind,yaml%20cert%3A%20false)), so overriding with `--auth none` is critical.

  **Persistent volume:** The Dockerfile doesn't directly handle volumes, but we note in documentation that the container’s `/home/coder/project` (or whichever directory users will use) should be mounted. The code-server image usually has a volume declared for `/home/coder/project`. In Kubernetes, our chart will create a PVC and mount it there. In Docker Compose, we’ll mount a named volume.

**Images and Tags:** For production, images should be tagged (e.g., `mycompany/remote-code-manager:v1.0.0`, `mycompany/remote-code-agent:v1.0.0`, `mycompany/code-server-workspace:v1.0.0`). The Helm charts’ default values will reference these images (initially one could use local builds or a test registry).

## Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx/Traefik)

A reverse proxy handles routing of external HTTP/HTTPS requests to the correct workspace container based on subdomain, and also enforces top-level authentication. We provide configuration for either **Nginx** or **Traefik** as options. The Helm chart in `charts/proxy` can be configured to deploy one or the other (or you pick which chart to install).

### Nginx Configuration (Wildcard Subdomain Routing)

For Nginx, we use a wildcard server name to catch all workspace subdomains. Example `nginx.conf` snippet:

```nginx
worker_processes 4;
events { worker_connections 1024; }
http {
    # Assuming we have a wildcard cert for *.dev.example.com
    upstream manager {
        server manager:3000;
    }
    map $http_host $workspace_name {
        # Extract the subdomain (before first dot) as workspace name
        ~^(?<user>[^.]+)\.dev\.example\.com$ $user;
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        server_name *.dev.example.com;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/wildcard.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/wildcard.key;

        # Authentication check with subrequest
        # The subrequest will be internal and not exposed externally
        auth_request /auth;

        location /auth {
            internal;
            proxy_pass http://manager:3000/api/auth/validate?user=$workspace_name;
            proxy_pass_request_body off;
            proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
            proxy_set_header X-Workspace-Name $workspace_name;
            # The manager will check the cookie/header of the original request forwarded automatically
        }

        # Proxy WebSocket upgrade (for VS Code live collaboration or terminals)
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        location / {
            # Each code-server listens on 8080 in its container. We route to the container by its name.
            # We assume the container's DNS name in the Docker network is workspace-<name>
            proxy_pass http://$workspace_name:8080;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
    }
}
```

In the above config:
- `server_name *.dev.example.com` catches all subdomains.
- We use a `$workspace_name` variable derived from the host. For Docker-based deployment, the assumption is that each container can be referred by a hostname like `alice` or `workspace-alice` on the internal network. Docker's internal DNS will resolve container names to their IPs on the network. So if we name containers by username or ID, we can route by that. (Alternatively, in Nginx we could maintain an `upstream` block per workspace but that requires config reloads. Using variables as shown requires the target to be resolvable – which works if the container name is resolvable. Nginx doesn't allow variable in `proxy_pass` without some tricks, but one can use `resolver` directive for DNS. Another approach is to use an Nginx stream or LUA script. However, given time, this static approach is a simplification. Traefik or Kubernetes ingress might handle this more dynamically.)
- The `auth_request /auth` tells Nginx to call the `/auth` location for each request. In `/auth`, we forward to manager’s validate endpoint. The manager can read the user's session cookie or token from that request (we ensure `proxy_set_header` to preserve needed headers like Cookie). The manager simply responds 200 or 401 with no body. Nginx then allows or denies accordingly ([NGINX Authentication Request - Simple Auth](https://simple-auth.zdyn.net/cookbooks/nginx-auth-request#:~:text=NGINX%20Authentication%20Request%20,authorized%20to%20access%20a)).
- We also upgrade WebSocket connections by setting the appropriate headers. This is important because VS Code server uses websockets for its editor backend communications.

This configuration would be loaded via a ConfigMap in Kubernetes or directly in the container in Docker. The provided `nginx.conf` in `deploy/` can be used as a starting point and customized (paths to certs, domain name, etc.).

**Note:** Instead of using container names, on Kubernetes we would use service DNS. For example, if each workspace has a K8s Service named `<workspace-id>` in namespace `workspaces`, then we could do `proxy_pass http://<workspace-id>.workspaces.svc.cluster.local:8080;`. This would require Nginx to be able to resolve those (the Nginx Pod must have DNS access to cluster services, which it would if in same cluster and namespace or with proper resolv conf).

### Traefik Configuration (Dynamic Docker Integration)

Traefik is an attractive alternative, especially for Docker Compose, because it can watch Docker events and automatically create routes for containers based on labels. We include an example `traefik.yml` that sets up Traefik with Docker provider and wildcard domain:

```yaml
# deploy/traefik/traefik.yml
entryPoints:
  websecure:
    address: ":443"
providers:
  docker:
    exposedByDefault: false
    network: workspace_net   # the internal network name
certificatesResolvers:
  default:
    acme:
      # ACME configuration for Let's Encrypt (using TLS challenge or DNS challenge for wildcard)
      email: admin@example.com
      storage: /letsencrypt/acme.json
      tlsChallenge: {}
```

In Docker Compose, we run Traefik container with:
```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:2.9
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.network=workspace_net"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.default.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.default.acme.email=admin@example.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.default.acme.storage=/acme.json"
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "./traefik/acme.json:/acme.json"
    networks:
      - workspace_net
```

Traefik will obtain a certificate (if TLS challenge is enabled and port 443 is accessible) or we could use DNS challenge for wildcard. For the sake of completeness, one might configure DNS challenge for a wildcard cert.

Each workspace container launched by manager needs appropriate labels, for example:
```yaml
Labels: {
  "traefik.enable": "true",
  "traefik.http.routers.ws-alice.rule": "Host(`alice.dev.example.com`)",
  "traefik.http.routers.ws-alice.entrypoints": "websecure",
  "traefik.http.routers.ws-alice.tls.certresolver": "default"
}
```
These labels instruct Traefik to route `alice.dev.example.com` to this container’s port. The nice thing is Traefik will also handle getting a TLS certificate via the default resolver configured above (so each subdomain gets covered by the wildcard or individual certs).

We also need Traefik to perform auth. We could incorporate a ForwardAuth middleware: Traefik can call an external service to validate auth on each request ([ForwardAuth - Traefik Labs documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/forwardauth/#:~:text=In%20Traefik%20Proxy%2C%20the%20HTTP,Read%20the%20technical%20documentation)). For example:
```yaml
  "traefik.http.routers.ws-alice.middlewares": "authCheck"
  "traefik.http.middlewares.authCheck.forwardauth.address": "http://manager:3000/api/auth/validate"
  "traefik.http.middlewares.authCheck.forwardauth.trustForwardHeader": "true"
```
We would have to adjust the manager’s `/validate` endpoint to accept perhaps a token header forwarded by Traefik (Traefik can pass the Authorization header by default or cookies). If using cookies, Traefik will forward them in the auth request.

Because Traefik config via labels can get verbose, the manager (when creating containers) would programmatically attach these labels with the correct user/domain each time. This dynamic approach is powerful: **as soon as the container is up, Traefik recognizes it and is ready to route traffic to it**, without needing to reload config. The user can then access their VS Code at the subdomain and Traefik will enforce auth via the manager.

### Kubernetes Ingress / Traefik

In Kubernetes, if not using our own Nginx, one can leverage an Ingress Controller. For instance, if using Nginx Ingress, we could create an Ingress resource for each workspace. The ingress resource might look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: alice-workspace-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "http://manager.default.svc.cluster.local:3000/api/auth/validate"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://auth.example.com/signin" # if using an external auth redirect
spec:
  rules:
  - host: alice.dev.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: alice-workspace-service
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - alice.dev.example.com
    secretName: wildcard-cert-secret
```
However, creating an ingress per workspace dynamically can be heavy if there are many. A wildcard ingress is an alternative: some ingress controllers allow wildcard host routing. For example, Nginx Ingress can use a wildcard host in rules (e.g., `host: "*.dev.example.com"`) and then pass the subdomain as a header to the service. But since each workspace is a different service in K8s, a single ingress rule might not easily map to multiple backends. (There are advanced solutions like wildcard ingress that uses regex capture and a custom resolver, but that’s complex.)

An easier K8s approach: use Traefik as the ingress controller in Kubernetes. Traefik can watch for services with certain annotations/labels similarly. Or use a Service of type LoadBalancer per workspace with a specific hostname (via ExternalDNS) – but that's not scalable.

Given these complexities, many implementations simply let the central control (manager) handle routing or use a proxy like we do.

Our Helm chart for **proxy** could deploy an Nginx pod with a config like above. It would include the wildcard certificate (either via secret mount or using cert-manager to provision it). The chart’s `values.yaml` would have fields for `domain: dev.example.com` and possibly the certificate secret names or how to get them.

**Wildcard TLS:** As mentioned, a wildcard certificate is needed for practicality ([Chapter 4. Configuring CodeReady Workspaces | Red Hat Product Documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_codeready_workspaces/2.13/html/installation_guide/configuring-che_crw#:~:text=match%20at%20L3121%20,all%20such%20subdomains%20for%20the)). Either use Let’s Encrypt (via DNS challenge for wildcard or one cert per subdomain via TLS challenge) or use an internal CA. Our documentation in `docs/SETUP.md` explains how to set up TLS (for instance, using CertManager in K8s, or providing your own certs in Docker Compose by mounting them into the proxy container).

## Kubernetes Helm Charts

We provide **Helm charts** to deploy the main components on Kubernetes with configurable options. This simplifies deployment and scaling on cloud environments.

### Manager Helm Chart (`charts/manager`)

This chart will deploy the manager service. Key elements:

- **Deployment**: Runs the manager container, by default 1 replica (it’s stateful in memory for tracking container status, but one could scale it if the design is adapted for stateless coordination or with an external database for state locking – initially, single replica is fine).
  - Environment variables or ConfigMap to configure:
    - `MANAGER_MODE`: `"docker"` or `"kubernetes"` – in Kubernetes mode, the manager might not mount Docker socket, and instead use K8s API. In Docker mode (perhaps if running manager on a single node outside K8s), it would require the socket. When deployed via Helm in K8s, we likely assume it will manage K8s resources, so it will use the k8s client.
    - `JWT_SECRET`: secret key for signing/verifying JWT tokens for auth.
    - `IDLE_TIMEOUT`: default inactivity period before stopping containers (if implemented at manager side).
    - `AGENT_TOKEN_SECRET`: base secret to generate agent tokens or to validate them.
    - Perhaps connection info for a database if we had one (not strictly needed for this implementation).
  - Service: Exposes the manager on a ClusterIP (if only used internally) and/or NodePort/LoadBalancer if we want to call its API from outside. In many setups, the manager's API might not be directly public except for maybe the user interface. But could be if needed.
  - RBAC: If manager will create K8s resources, we include a Role with rights to create Pods, Services, Ingresses in a certain namespace (or ClusterRole if spanning namespaces). ServiceAccount for manager is created and bound to that role.
  - The chart allows specifying the image (`image.repository` and `image.tag`), and resources for the manager pod.

Example values (partial):
```yaml
image:
  repository: mycompany/remote-code-manager
  tag: v1.0.0
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

replicaCount: 1

env:
  JWT_SECRET: "please-set-a-secret"  # In practice, use a Kubernetes secret for this
  MODE: "kubernetes"
  BASE_DOMAIN: "dev.example.com"
  # ...other envs

service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 3000
rbac:
  create: true
```

### Proxy Helm Chart (`charts/proxy`)

This chart deploys the Nginx or Traefik proxy in the cluster:

- **Nginx**: If selected, it will create a Deployment for Nginx. A ConfigMap will contain the `nginx.conf`. The values can template the domain name and maybe refer to a secret that contains TLS certs. We might allow two modes: using an existing TLS secret, or using cert-manager (the chart could optionally create a Certificate resource if cert-manager is installed).
- **Traefik**: If selected instead, the chart might deploy Traefik as a Deployment (or DaemonSet if needed). But since Traefik has an official chart, we could also just document using that rather than reinvent. We might include a minimal Traefik config for this specific use-case.

For the sake of clarity, assume Nginx. The proxy chart values:
```yaml
proxy:
  type: nginx  # or traefik
domain: "dev.example.com"
tls:
  secretName: "wildcard-dev-example-com"  # secret containing wildcard cert for *.dev.example.com
```

The Nginx Deployment mounts the secret at `/etc/nginx/certs` and the ConfigMap at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Service for Nginx will be LoadBalancer on port 443.

If using Traefik, the values would include ACME config or if an external LB is used, etc. Traefik might not need a separate chart if you use official ones, but ours can simplify by hardcoding needed middleware and entrypoint settings.

### Workspace Helm Chart (`charts/workspace`)

This chart provides a template for a **workspace environment**. It’s not meant to be deployed manually for every user via `helm install` (though one could), but rather as a reference or if one wanted to pre-create some static persistent workspaces.

The chart takes inputs like `workspaceId` or `user`. It then defines:

- **Deployment** (or directly a Pod) for the workspace:
  - Contains the code-server container (from the custom image) and possibly an agent container (if separate). If using one container approach, we just have one container in this Pod.
  - Environment variables:
    - `WORKSPACE_ID`, `USER_NAME` for identification.
    - `MANAGER_HOST` perhaps, so the agent knows where to connect.
    - `AGENT_TOKEN` for authenticating the agent.
  - Volume mount: Mounts a PersistentVolumeClaim at `/home/coder`. The PVC is either created by the chart or expected to exist (could use volumeTemplates in a StatefulSet, or just create PVC via a template).
  - Labels: The Pod/Deployment gets labels like `workspace=<id>` and annotation if needed (for networking).
  - Service: Expose port 8080 of the pod. The service name could be the workspace name. The chart can name it using release name or a value. This service isn’t externally accessible, but is used by the proxy internally.

- **PersistentVolumeClaim**:
  - The chart can define a PVC, e.g., `${workspaceId}-pvc`, with storage size from values (say default 10Gi). Storage class can be specified via values. This ensures each workspace has a dedicated storage.

We might actually prefer a StatefulSet for workspaces if we were pre-provisioning a fixed number, but since these are ephemeral on demand, a Deployment is fine (the name of the deployment or pod includes the workspaceId so it’s unique).

**Helm usage:** If one wanted to manually create a workspace via Helm (instead of the manager API), they could run:
```
helm install alice-workspace charts/workspace --set user=alice --set workspaceId=alice
```
This would deploy a workspace for user Alice. However, normally the manager would be doing something equivalent via code.

### Multi-Cluster or Scaling Considerations

Helm charts can be adjusted for different scenarios:
- If you want a separate namespace per user, you could install the workspace chart into a new namespace each time. (This is similar to Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces approach: one project per user for isolation ([Chapter 4. Configuring CodeReady Workspaces | Red Hat Product Documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_codeready_workspaces/2.13/html/installation_guide/configuring-che_crw#:~:text=4)).)
- The architecture supports multiple nodes: in K8s, pods will be scheduled as needed. In Docker (single node), scaling beyond one machine requires something like Docker Swarm or just multiple instances of this whole stack (one per machine). A future enhancement could be to have the manager manage multiple nodes via Docker API or use a clustering technology.
- The manager could be scaled for HA (active-passive or even active-active if stateless). To be stateless, one would externalize state: e.g., use a shared database to track workspaces rather than in-memory. This would allow multiple manager replicas to coordinate (with leader election or simply each handling separate requests but reading/writing same state).

Our provided charts focus on a single-instance manager with the assumption of running in a controlled environment.

## Deployment Examples

This section provides example configurations for deploying the entire system in both **Docker Compose (single host)** and **Kubernetes (Helm)**, along with steps and best practices.

### Docker Compose Deployment (Single-Host)

For small-scale or development setups, you can use Docker Compose to run the manager and proxy on one machine and let the manager spin up workspace containers on that same machine.

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed, a domain configured (with wildcard DNS if possible) pointing to this host.

An example `docker-compose.yml` is provided in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`. Key contents:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  manager:
    image: mycompany/remote-code-manager:v1.0.0
    environment:
      MODE: "docker"
      JWT_SECRET: "supersecretjwt"
      BASE_DOMAIN: "dev.example.com"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"   # allow manager to control Docker
    networks:
      - workspace_net
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"   # API (optionally exposed for demonstration; can be removed in production)
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.50"
          memory: "512M"

  traefik:
    image: traefik:2.9
    command:
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.network=workspace_net"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.default.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.default.acme.email=admin@example.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.default.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
      - "--log.level=INFO"
      - "--accesslog=false"
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"    # for ACME HTTP-01 challenge if needed, or redirect to https
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "./traefik/acme.json:/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    networks:
      - workspace_net

networks:
  workspace_net:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true   # internal network: no external access directly ([docker network create | Docker Docs
](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/network/create/#:~:text=Network%20internal%20mode%20%28))
```

In this compose file:
- We define an `internal` network `workspace_net` ([docker network create | Docker Docs
](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/network/create/#:~:text=Network%20internal%20mode%20%28)). Both manager and Traefik join it. Workspace containers that manager creates will also be attached to this network (manager uses Docker API to do that). Being internal means containers on this network cannot reach the internet directly, and are not reachable from outside, only via Traefik (which has one foot in this network and one foot on the host via published 443 port).
- Manager has the Docker socket to manage containers. (Security note: This means manager container effectively has root over the host; ensure the manager code is secure and only accessible to trusted users, or use Docker socket proxy if available).
- Traefik is set up to handle HTTPS on port 443. It will use TLS challenge to get certificates (this requires the domain’s port 443 to be accessible and perhaps an existing certificate or a temporary self-signed until ACME completes).
- We didn't explicitly include an environment for auth in manager here (like user credentials). In a real setup, you might have a default admin user that you configure via an env or volume (or call an API after startup to create admin). For now, one could include a static `ADMIN_TOKEN` env and use that for API calls. Alternatively, the first run, you exec into manager or call a special endpoint to set up an admin account.

**Running:** Once `docker-compose up -d` is executed, Traefik and manager start. Initially, no workspaces are running. You can then use the manager API (or the SDK or a web UI if built) to create a workspace. For example:

```bash
# Create a workspace for user alice via API (using an admin token for auth)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user": "alice"}' http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces
```

This should respond with a JSON containing the workspace ID (say "alice" or "workspace-xyz123") and perhaps the assigned domain `alice.dev.example.com`. The manager will have launched the container and Traefik will have picked up labels. Within a few seconds, you should be able to open `https://alice.dev.example.com` in a browser and see the VS Code interface, already authenticated if you have a session with the manager (if using cookies), or it might prompt for a token if we integrate that. If not integrated, another method is to use some SSO or to simply require logging into manager UI first which sets a cookie that Traefik's forwardAuth uses.

We can also include in the compose an **optional** web UI container or reuse manager to serve a UI for login and launching workspaces (not specified, but likely a real product would have a dashboard).

**Volume persistence:** Docker named volumes will preserve data. If you tear down compose, the named volumes (like the ones created for each workspace) remain unless removed. To backup or inspect user data, you can directly access those volumes on the host (often under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). In Kubernetes, PVCs handle persistence.

**Stopping/cleanup:** To stop a workspace via API:
```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/api/workspaces/alice
```
The manager will stop and remove the container (and possibly remove the volume if configured to do so – we might not auto-delete volumes unless a user truly deletes the workspace, to avoid data loss).

We also provide a script `scripts/cleanup_inactive.sh` for example, which could be run via cron on the manager host to remove any stopped containers or dangling volumes older than X days, etc., as a housekeeping measure.

### Kubernetes Deployment (Helm Charts)

For a production-ready multi-user setup, Kubernetes is recommended. Ensure you have a K8s cluster and the necessary privileges to install these Helm charts, and a wildcard DNS ready.

**1. Deploy Manager:**  
```bash
helm install remote-code-manager ./charts/manager \
  --set image.repository=mycompany/remote-code-manager --set image.tag=v1.0.0 \
  --set env.JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 16) \
  --set env.MODE=kubernetes \
  --set env.BASE_DOMAIN=dev.example.com \
  --set service.type=ClusterIP
```
This installs the manager in the default namespace (you may create a separate namespace like `remote-code`). The manager will run inside K8s and use the K8s API to manage workspaces (since MODE=kubernetes). The Docker socket is not mounted in this case. Instead, the manager will need permissions: our chart by default sets up RBAC so the manager’s service account can create pods/services. (Review the RBAC to ensure it's not overly permissive.)

**2. Deploy Proxy:**  
If using Nginx:
```bash
helm install remote-code-proxy ./charts/proxy \
  --set proxy.type=nginx \
  --set domain=dev.example.com \
  --set tls.secretName=wildcard-tls
```
You need to create the TLS secret `wildcard-tls` beforehand, containing the certificate and key for `*.dev.example.com` (and the root domain if needed). This will expose an Nginx service (LoadBalancer). If using an ingress controller instead, you might skip this and configure ingress accordingly.

If using Traefik ingress controller, you could instead do:
```bash
helm install traefik traefik/traefik -n traefik --create-namespace \
  --set ports.websecure.port=443 --set ports.websecure.ssl=true \
  --set ingressRoute.enabled=true \
  --set additionalArguments={"--entryPoints.websecure.address=:443","--certificatesResolvers.default.acme.dnsChallenge.provider=cloudflare","--certificatesResolvers.default.acme.email=admin@example.com","--certificatesResolvers.default.acme.storage=acme.json","--certificatesResolvers.default.acme.dnsChallenge.domains=*.dev.example.com"}
```
(This uses a DNS challenge example with Cloudflare; specifics vary. Alternatively, use cert-manager to provision the wildcard certificate and Traefik or Nginx just use it.)

**3. Workspaces on Kubernetes:**  
With the manager in K8s mode, when a new workspace is requested, the manager will create a Kubernetes **Pod** (or Deployment) and related Service/PVC. The logic could be:
- Manager generates a manifest from a template (similar to what our `charts/workspace/templates` define) and applies it via the Kubernetes API.
- Or manager uses the Helm SDK or CLI to install the `workspace` chart. This might be overkill per workspace because Helm will track each as a release. A direct K8s API approach might be simpler (less overhead).
  
Either way, once a workspace pod is running:
  - The agent inside connects back to manager (the manager’s service is reachable in cluster by DNS).
  - The code-server service is created so that Nginx (proxy) can route to it. In our Nginx config, we might not explicitly list every service. Instead, we could do some DNS trick or have Nginx resolve `<workspace-id>.workspace.svc` as earlier described. If we deploy proxy in the same namespace as workspaces, the container name resolution approach may not work. Another approach: the manager could update the Nginx config via its config API whenever a new workspace appears, but that complicates things.
  
One simpler pattern: run a single Nginx that *proxies to manager* for all code-server traffic. Then manager in turn proxies to the correct pod. But that adds an extra hop and complexity (manager becomes a reverse proxy as well).
  
Given the time, we'll assume the proxy has a way to reach the correct service. If using Traefik ingress controller, it can label services for routing.

For example, manager creates a Service with annotation `traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.hostname=alice.dev.example.com`. Traefik will automatically create a route. This is similar to how Traefik's Kubernetes CRDs work.

**4. Accessing the IDE:**  
After deploying, users would access `https://<workspace>.<domain>` as given. For initial onboarding, you might manually create a workspace for each user or have an UI where user clicks "New Workspace". The manager could also be configured to auto-create a workspace when a new user logs in for the first time.

**Scaling and Best Practices:**

- **Scaling Manager:** If user count is large, one manager might become a bottleneck. You can scale it vertically (give more CPU) or horizontally. Horizontal scaling requires careful handling of container creation conflicts. You could elect one manager instance as leader for creating/deleting containers while others are read-only for status. Alternatively, partition users among managers. A simple approach if needed: run one manager per ~100 users and use DNS or load-balancer to route user API requests to the correct manager based on user (this requires a consistent hashing or lookup).
- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus to scrape metrics from manager (if exposed) and perhaps node metrics to monitor container resource usage. Use Grafana to set up dashboards (e.g., number of active workspaces, CPU per workspace, etc.). Set alerts if a workspace is consuming excessive resources or if an agent heartbeat is lost (indicating a crash).
- **Logging:** Centralize logs by using a logging driver or sidecar. In Kubernetes, logs are in Pod stdout (which can be collected by Fluentd/Elastic or CloudWatch etc.). The manager logs could include user actions for audit.
- **Security Enhancements:** 
  - Consider running containers with a seccomp profile or using gVisor/Kata Containers if you need stronger isolation (especially if users run untrusted code, containers are a lighter isolation than VMs).
  - If users need Docker-in-Docker in their workspaces (some might want to run Docker inside VS Code), that’s tricky. As code-server FAQ suggests, you could bind the host socket into the container ([FAQ: code-server config, install extensions & more | code-server Docs](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/FAQ#:~:text=Can%20I%20use%20Docker%20in,server%20container)), but that breaks isolation (giving them control of host Docker!). A safer approach is truly give each user a VM (which is beyond our container approach). Alternatively, use Kubernetes-in-Kubernetes solutions or DinD sidecar with user namespaces. This is an advanced scenario.
  - Regularly update the base images for security patches. Also update code-server version as needed.
  - Use network policies (in K8s) to restrict pods from talking to others if they somehow got the IP.
  - The manager’s auth should ideally integrate with an SSO (OAuth2, SAML, etc.) so that you don't manage plain passwords. But for this codebase, a simple user database can be implemented (perhaps storing hashed passwords in a file or lightweight SQLite for demo). For now, initial seed data might include an admin user with a known password for first login (to be changed immediately).

- **Real-time Collaboration:** code-server supports VS Code Live Share extensions and such, which might require some ports or additional considerations (not specifically covered, but presumably works out of the box if extension is installed).

- **Cleaning Up Resources:** The system should handle workspace cleanup on both graceful and ungraceful scenarios. For example, if the manager crashes, the containers might continue running. On restart, manager should reconcile with the existing containers (Dockerode can list running containers with a certain label to reconstruct state). Similarly, in K8s, if manager is down, workspaces still run; when it comes back, it can query the cluster for pods with label `app=workspace` to sync state. We may implement a sync routine on manager startup to adopt existing workspaces.

- **Idle scheduling:** For optimizing resource use, consider implementing an **idle pool**: Stop containers after X minutes idle, but quickly start them again when user returns (perhaps with their data persisted, the restart might take only a few seconds). Alternatively, keep a small pool of pre-warmed containers to reduce startup latency.

## Operational Best Practices

**Modularity:** Each piece (manager, agent, proxy) can be developed and tested in isolation. You can run the manager with a fake Docker stub for unit tests, run agent with a dummy manager for integration tests, etc. The code is organized to keep concerns separate (API vs Docker logic vs WS vs auth). This modularity also allows swapping components (e.g., use a different reverse proxy if needed, or integrate with a different container backend).

**Security Recap:**
- Use HTTPS everywhere. Even inside the cluster, prefer TLS for WebSocket if possible (or at least ensure the cluster network is trusted).
- Rotate secrets (JWT secret, tokens). The agent token could be one-time per workspace.
- Do not run containers as root. The code-server image runs as a user by default. Our additions should not require root, except maybe to install packages. If you must run as root to install, switch back to the `coder` user for running.
- Limit container capabilities – in Kubernetes, use PodSecurityPolicies or Pod Security Standards to prevent escalation (the workspaces likely only need basic capabilities).
- If using Docker, consider enabling user namespace remapping for the daemon to further isolate container UIDs from host.
- **Backup** user volumes if needed – since data is persistent in PVC or volumes, set up a backup job (e.g., nightly snapshot of volumes).

**Scaling:**
- Test the system with concurrent workspace launches to see how it behaves. Docker can start many containers quickly, but you might hit disk or network limits. K8s will schedule pods gradually; make sure to configure resource quotas if needed to avoid overload.
- If a single host can't handle all users, scale out with K8s nodes. Use taints/tolerations or separate node pools if you want to segregate workspace pods from other system components.
- Horizontal Pod Autoscale (HPA): You might auto-scale the manager if CPU goes high (though statefulness is a concern). The proxy (Nginx/Traefik) can be replicated behind a service if needed (Traefik can be run in multiple replicas, Nginx as well; just ensure each has the same cert and sees the same backend pods — usually okay with service discovery).
- **Multi-Region:** Out of scope here, but if needed, you could deploy separate instances in different regions and perhaps have a global routing based on user location.

Finally, extensive **documentation** is provided in `docs/`:
- **Setup Guide** (`docs/SETUP.md`): step-by-step instructions to configure DNS, certificates, and deploy using the provided methods.
- **User Guide**: how end-users can connect to their workspace (e.g., using the web browser, or even using VS Code desktop via Remote-SSH or Remote-WSL pointing to these containers – since code-server can act as a backend for VS Code desktop by configuring VS Code to connect to it).
- **Developer Guide**: for contributors to this codebase, explaining code structure and how to extend it (for example, adding a new API endpoint).
- **Troubleshooting**: common issues and solutions (can't connect, container won't start, etc.).

By following this architecture and using the provided codebase, you can reliably offer cloud-hosted VS Code environments for multiple users with isolation and scalability, similar to services like Gitpod or Coder, using open source tools and standard technologies.
