# Authentication Flow Summary

## Overview

The authentication flow in the VSCode Remote MCP project has been successfully implemented and tested. The flow uses environment variables for configuration and follows secure token management practices.

## Key Components

1. **Environment Configuration (`env.ts`)**
   - Centralizes all environment variable access
   - Provides type-safe defaults and validation
   - Uses the `.env` file for configuration (see `.env.example`)

2. **Authentication Manager (`auth-manager.ts`)**
   - Manages authentication tokens for MCP servers
   - Handles token storage, retrieval, validation, and refresh
   - Implements token expiration and secure hashing
   - Uses environment variables for default tokens

3. **Client State Manager (`client-state-model.ts`)**
   - Tracks connection, session, and authentication states
   - Provides state change notifications
   - Maintains a clean separation of concerns

4. **Connection Manager (`connection-manager.ts`)**
   - Manages WebSocket connections to MCP servers
   - Handles authentication, reconnection, and message routing
   - Uses the Authentication Manager for token validation

## Security Features

- **Token Hashing**: Tokens are securely hashed before storage
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens can be set to expire after a certain time
- **Environment-based Configuration**: No hardcoded secrets
- **Validation**: Proper validation of tokens and authentication state

## Test Coverage

The authentication flow is covered by comprehensive tests:

- `authentication-flow.test.js`: Tests the complete authentication flow
- `auth-manager.test.js`: Tests the Authentication Manager in isolation
- Mock implementations for testing are available in the `tests/mocks` directory

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used for authentication:

```
# Authentication
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=local_dev_token
MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=true
```

## Usage

To use the authentication flow in your code:

```typescript
import { MCPAuthManager } from './utils/auth-manager';
import { MCPConnectionManager } from './utils/connection-manager';

// Create an auth manager
const authManager = new MCPAuthManager();

// Create a connection manager
const connectionManager = new MCPConnectionManager({
  sendMessage: (message) => { /* ... */ },
  url: 'ws://localhost:3001'
});

// Connect with authentication
const connected = await connectionManager.connect(
  'server-id',
  'client-id',
  'workspace-id'
);

if (connected) {
  console.log('Successfully authenticated and connected');
} else {
  console.error('Authentication failed');
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use environment variables for tokens and sensitive data
2. Validate tokens before using them
3. Implement token expiration for enhanced security
4. Use secure hashing for token storage
5. Handle authentication errors gracefully
