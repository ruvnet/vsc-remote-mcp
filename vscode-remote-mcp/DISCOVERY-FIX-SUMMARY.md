# MCP Discovery Endpoints Fix Summary

## Problem

The VSCode Remote MCP server was experiencing issues with the discovery endpoints. Specifically:

1. The `mcp.discovery` and `mcp.listTools` endpoints were timing out with "MCP error -32001: Request timed out"
2. The server wasn't properly handling these discovery requests
3. The response format for discovery endpoints needed to be standardized

## Solution

The following changes were implemented to fix these issues:

### 1. Enhanced Discovery Endpoint Handlers

- Added explicit try/catch blocks in all discovery endpoint handlers
- Ensured proper response formatting for all discovery endpoints
- Added a new `handleListResources` endpoint handler for completeness

### 2. Improved Timeout Handling

- Added timeout handling for all request types, not just tool calls
- Ensured proper cleanup of timeouts for all request types
- Added explicit timeout handling in the main request handler

### 3. Better Error Handling

- Added detailed error logging for all endpoint handlers
- Ensured consistent error response format
- Added proper error codes and messages

### 4. Enhanced Debugging

- Added debug logging throughout the codebase
- Added a DEBUG_MODE flag that can be enabled via environment variables
- Improved logging of request/response cycles

### 5. Protocol Standardization

- Added a PROTOCOL_VERSION constant
- Ensured all responses follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
- Standardized the server capabilities response format

## Testing

A new test script (`test-discovery-fix.js`) was created to verify that the discovery endpoints are working correctly. This script:

1. Starts the MCP server
2. Sends requests to all discovery endpoints
3. Verifies that responses are received without timeouts
4. Validates the response format

## How to Test

To test the fix, run:

```bash
node test-discovery-fix.js
```

This will start the server, test all discovery endpoints, and report the results.

## Additional Improvements

1. Added health check endpoint for network reachability testing
2. Enhanced server startup logging
3. Added protocol version to server capabilities
4. Improved error handling for edge cases

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive validation of request parameters
2. Add more detailed documentation for each endpoint
3. Consider adding rate limiting for requests
4. Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms
