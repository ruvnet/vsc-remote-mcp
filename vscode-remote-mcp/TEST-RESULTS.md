9. message-flow.test.js

## Code Coverage Issues
Several modules have low code coverage:

1. **message-flow-validator.js**: 58.74% statements, 48.43% branches
2. **message-validator.js**: 2.85% statements, 0% branches
3. **request-response-validator.js**: 0.69% statements, 0% branches

## Recommendations
1. **Increase Test Coverage**: Focus on improving test coverage for the validator modules, especially request-response-validator.js which has almost no coverage.
2. **Fix Failing Tests**: Investigate and fix the 6 failing tests.
3. **Refactor Complex Modules**: Some modules have very complex branch logic that's difficult to test completely. Consider refactoring these into smaller, more testable functions.
4. **Add Edge Case Tests**: Add more tests for edge cases, especially for error handling scenarios.

## Next Steps
1. Create targeted tests for the low-coverage modules
2. Debug and fix failing tests
3. Refactor complex validation logic into smaller, more testable units
4. Implement continuous integration to run these tests automatically
