## Security Model

The VSCode Remote MCP system is designed with a security-first approach, implementing multiple layers of protection:

1. **Authentication Layer**: Verifies the identity of clients connecting to the server
2. **Authorization Layer**: Controls what actions authenticated clients can perform
3. **Transport Layer**: Secures the communication channel between clients and server
4. **Session Layer**: Manages secure collaboration sessions
5. **Audit Layer**: Logs security-relevant events for monitoring and analysis

## Authentication

### Authentication Mechanisms

The VSCode Remote MCP system uses token-based authentication to verify client identities:

1. **Token Generation**: Tokens are generated using cryptographically secure random generators
2. **Token Transmission**: Tokens are hashed before transmission to prevent exposure
3. **Token Validation**: The server validates tokens by comparing hashes
4. **Token Expiration**: Tokens have a configurable expiration time

### Authentication Flow

```
Client                                Server
  |                                     |
  |-- connection (with token hash) ---->|
  |                                     | (validates token)
  |<-- connection_ack or error ---------|
  |                                     |
```

### Authentication Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Tokens**: Generate tokens with high entropy (at least 128 bits)
2. **Limit Token Lifetime**: Set reasonable expiration times for tokens (default: 1 hour)
3. **Rotate Tokens**: Implement token rotation for long-running sessions
4. **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms
5. **Revocation**: Implement token revocation for compromised tokens

## Token Management

### Token Storage

Tokens should be stored securely:

- **Client-side**: Use VSCode's secure storage API or platform keychain services
- **Server-side**: Store only token hashes, never raw tokens

Example client-side token storage implementation:

```javascript
class TokenManager {
  constructor() {
    this.context = vscode.ExtensionContext;
  }

  async storeToken(serverId, token) {
    // Use VSCode's secure storage
    await this.context.secrets.store(`mcp-token-${serverId}`, token);
  }

  async getToken(serverId) {
    return await this.context.secrets.get(`mcp-token-${serverId}`);
  }

  async deleteToken(serverId) {
    await this.context.secrets.delete(`mcp-token-${serverId}`);
  }
}
```

### Token Hashing

Always hash tokens before transmission:

```javascript
async function hashToken(token) {
  // Use a secure hashing algorithm
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(token);
  const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
  const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
  const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
  return hashHex;
}
```

### Token Refresh

For long-running sessions, implement token refresh:

```javascript
async function refreshToken(clientId, oldToken) {
  // Generate a new token
  const newToken = generateSecureToken();
  
  // Hash the new token
  const newTokenHash = await hashToken(newToken);
  
  // Send token refresh request
  const response = await sendTokenRefreshRequest(clientId, newTokenHash);
  
  if (response.status === 'accepted') {
    // Store the new token
    await storeToken(clientId, newToken);
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

## Data Security

### Data in Transit

All data transmitted between clients and the server should be protected:

1. **Message Integrity**: Ensure messages cannot be tampered with
2. **Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
3. **Non-repudiation**: Ensure actions cannot be denied by the sender

Implementation considerations:

- Use TLS for transport security when not using VSCode's built-in security
- Implement message signing for critical operations
- Consider adding nonce values to prevent replay attacks

### Data at Rest

Sensitive data stored by the system should be protected:

1. **Configuration Files**: Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text
2. **Logs**: Redact sensitive information from logs
3. **Session Data**: Encrypt session data when stored

### Data Minimization

Follow the principle of data minimization:

1. Only collect and transmit data necessary for the operation of the system
2. Implement automatic data purging for inactive sessions
3. Allow users to delete their data

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration

When deploying the MCP server, configure firewalls appropriately:

1. Only expose the necessary ports (default: 3001)
2. Restrict access to trusted IP addresses when possible
3. Use rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse:

```javascript
class RateLimiter {
  constructor(maxRequestsPerMinute = 100) {
    this.requestCounts = new Map();
    this.maxRequestsPerMinute = maxRequestsPerMinute;
    this.startResetInterval();
  }
  
  isRateLimited(clientId) {
    const count = this.requestCounts.get(clientId) || 0;
    if (count >= this.maxRequestsPerMinute) {
      return true;
    }
    
    this.requestCounts.set(clientId, count + 1);
    return false;
  }
  
  startResetInterval() {
    setInterval(() => {
      this.requestCounts.clear();
    }, 60000); // Reset every minute
  }
}
```

### Secure Deployment

When deploying the MCP server:

1. Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with TLS termination
2. Keep the server software updated
3. Run the server with minimal privileges
4. Use containerization for isolation

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the VSCode Remote MCP system, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed
2. Send a detailed report to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested mitigations
3. Allow a reasonable time for response and remediation before disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Timeline

Our typical response timeline:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
2. **Validation**: Within 1 week of acknowledgment
3. **Remediation Plan**: Within 2 weeks of validation
4. **Fix Implementation**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity
5. **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed

### Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we appreciate and acknowledge security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.
