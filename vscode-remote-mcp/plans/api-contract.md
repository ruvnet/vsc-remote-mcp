# VSCode Remote MCP System: API Contract Specification

This document serves as the main entry point for the VSCode Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) system API contract specification. It provides an overview of the system and links to detailed documentation for each aspect of the API.

## Introduction

The VSCode Remote MCP system enables collaborative development across multiple VSCode instances using a STDIO communication transport layer. It allows developers to share terminals, synchronize editor states, and collaborate in real-time regardless of their physical location or development environment.

## Documentation Structure

This API contract specification is organized into the following sections:

1. [Overview and Message Format](01-overview-and-message-format.md) - Introduction to the system and basic message format
2. [Message Types and Payloads](02-message-types-and-payloads.md) - Detailed definitions of all message types and their payloads
3. [Request/Response Schemas](03-request-response-schemas.md) - Patterns for request/response communication
4. [Message Flow Diagrams](04-message-flow-diagrams.md) - Visual representations of key message flows
5. [Client State Model](05-client-state-model.md) - State machine definitions for client behavior
6. [Authentication Flow](06-authentication-flow.md) - Authentication mechanisms and token handling
7. [Error Handling Patterns](07-error-handling-patterns.md) - Error handling approach and recovery strategies

## Key Concepts

### STDIO Transport Layer

The VSCode Remote MCP system uses the Standard Input/Output (STDIO) as its primary transport layer. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works consistently across all platforms that support VSCode
- **Simplicity**: No need for network configuration or port management
- **Security**: Communication is contained within the VSCode process
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with VSCode's extension architecture

### Message-Based Communication

All communication in the system is based on JSON-formatted messages with a standardized structure:

```typescript
interface MCPMessage {
  type: string;       // The message type identifier
  payload: any;       // The message payload (type varies by message type)
  id?: string;        // Optional message ID for request-response correlation
  timestamp?: string; // ISO timestamp of when the message was created
}
```

### Collaboration Sessions

The system organizes collaboration into sessions, where multiple clients can join and work together:

- Sessions can be created by any client
- Clients can join existing sessions
- Session owners can control access to their sessions
- Sessions maintain shared state across all participants

### Real-Time Synchronization

The system provides real-time synchronization of:

- Editor content and cursor positions
- Terminal input and output
- Extension state
- Workspace configuration

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing the VSCode Remote MCP system, consider the following:

### Performance

- Minimize message size to reduce latency
- Batch small changes when appropriate
- Implement efficient diffing algorithms for document changes
- Use compression for large payloads

### Security

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all incoming messages
- Sanitize content to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Reliability

- Implement robust error handling
- Provide reconnection mechanisms
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Getting Started

To get started with the VSCode Remote MCP system:

1. Review the [Overview and Message Format](01-overview-and-message-format.md) document
2. Understand the [Message Types and Payloads](02-message-types-and-payloads.md)
3. Study the [Message Flow Diagrams](04-message-flow-diagrams.md) to understand typical interactions
4. Implement the client according to the [Client State Model](05-client-state-model.md)
5. Add authentication following the [Authentication Flow](06-authentication-flow.md)
6. Implement error handling based on [Error Handling Patterns](07-error-handling-patterns.md)

## Next Steps

After reviewing this API contract specification, you can:

1. Implement a client library for the VSCode Remote MCP system
2. Develop a server implementation that handles multiple clients
3. Create VSCode extensions that leverage the collaboration features
4. Extend the protocol with additional message types for specific use cases
