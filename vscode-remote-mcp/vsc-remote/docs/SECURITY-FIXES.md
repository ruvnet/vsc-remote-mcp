# Security Fixes Implemented

This document summarizes the security fixes implemented in version 1.2.0 of the vsc-remote package.

## Command Injection Protections

1. **Replaced `exec` with `spawn`**
   - Replaced string-based command execution with array-based arguments
   - Implemented `execSecure` function for safer command execution
   - Eliminated shell injection vulnerabilities

2. **Input Sanitization**
   - Added comprehensive validation for all user inputs
   - Implemented strict type checking for all parameters
   - Added regex pattern validation for sensitive inputs

3. **Path Traversal Prevention**
   - Added `validateFilePath` function to prevent directory traversal attacks
   - Normalized paths to resolve any '..' or '.' segments
   - Added explicit checks for path traversal attempts
   - Implemented proper path access validation

## Secure Password Handling

1. **Enhanced Password Generation**
   - Improved random password generation with crypto-secure methods
   - Increased default password complexity requirements

2. **Password Validation**
   - Implemented comprehensive password strength validation
   - Added configurable minimum password length
   - Added specific checks for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Improved error messages for password validation failures

3. **Secure Password Storage**
   - Implemented secure temporary file storage for passwords
   - Set proper file permissions (0o600) for password files
   - Added automatic cleanup of password files after use
   - Used secure directories with restricted permissions (0o700)

## Authentication Improvements

1. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - Implemented token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
   - Added secure token generation using cryptographically secure methods
   - Implemented token verification middleware for WebSocket connections

2. **Secure Token Storage**
   - Added secure storage of authentication tokens
   - Implemented proper file permissions for token files
   - Added option to generate new tokens when needed

3. **CLI Authentication Options**
   - Added command-line options for authentication token management
   - Implemented token display for easy connection

## Input Validation and Sanitization

1. **Parameter Validation**
   - Added comprehensive validation for all tool parameters
   - Implemented type checking and range validation
   - Added specific error messages for validation failures

2. **Docker Command Security**
   - Improved Docker command security with array-based arguments
   - Added validation for Docker-specific parameters
   - Implemented environment variable validation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error reporting with specific error codes
   - Added detailed error messages for security-related failures
   - Implemented proper error propagation

## Additional Security Measures

1. **Secure File Operations**
   - Added proper file permission handling
   - Implemented secure temporary file creation and cleanup
   - Added validation for file operations

2. **Environment Variable Handling**
   - Improved environment variable validation
   - Added sanitization for environment variables passed to containers
   - Implemented secure defaults for sensitive settings

3. **Logging Improvements**
   - Enhanced logging for security-related events
   - Added debug logging for troubleshooting
   - Ensured sensitive information is not logged

## NPM Package Security

1. **Package Configuration**
   - Updated package.json with secure configuration
   - Added verification script for pre-publishing checks
   - Implemented proper file inclusion/exclusion with .npmignore

2. **Documentation**
   - Added security documentation
   - Updated README with security best practices
   - Added examples for secure usage

These security fixes address the vulnerabilities identified in the security review and provide a more robust and secure foundation for the vsc-remote package.
